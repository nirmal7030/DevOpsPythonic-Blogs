🌟 Hello DevOps Adventurers! A new day, a new challenge. Inspired by the amazing Shubham Londhe and his #90daysofdevops journey, let's dive into the world of Python data types and data structures. Let's unravel the magic behind coding! 💻✨

## **Understanding Data Types: Your Building Blocks**

Data types are like the ingredients that make up your coding recipe. They help us organize and work with different kinds of data. In Python, everything's like a magical object, and data types are the spells that define them. Here's a quick look at some data types:

* **Numeric** 🧮: Integers, complex numbers, and floating-point numbers.
    
* **Sequential** 📜: Strings (words and text), lists (ordered collections), and tuples (kind of like lists but unchangeable).
    
* **Boolean** 🚦: Represents either `True` or `False`.
    
* **Set** 🔮: A group of items without duplicates, in no particular order.
    
* **Dictionary** 📚: Store stuff like a map - with key-value pairs.
    

Want to know a data type? Just use the `type()` function. For instance, if you have `my_variable`, type `type(my_variable)`.

## **Data Structures: Your Coding Tools**

Think of data structures as your coding toolbox. They help you organize your stuff efficiently. Python makes these tools user-friendly. Here are a few essential ones:

### **Lists: Your Collection Bins**

* 📦 Ordered collections.
    
* 🎨 Mix of different items.
    
* 📝 Create, modify, access with ease.
    

```plaintext
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]

# Accessing elements
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Modifying elements
fruits[1] = "pear"
print(fruits)     # Output: ['apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'grape']

# Appending an element
fruits.append("kiwi")
print(fruits)     # Output: ['apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'grape', 'kiwi']
```

### **Tuples: The Immutable Helpers**

* 🧊 Like lists, but frozen.
    
* 🔒 Elements can't change.
    
* 🧤 Ensures your data's integrity.
    

```plaintext
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (3, 4)

# Accessing elements
x = coordinates[0]
y = coordinates[1]
print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}")  # Output: x: 3, y: 4
```

### **Dictionaries: Your Magical Maps**

* 🗺️ Key-value pairs for data.
    
* 📝 Fast retrieval based on keys.
    
* 🔮 Manage configurations like a pro.
    

```plaintext
# Creating a dictionary
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science"
}

# Accessing values
print(student["name"])  # Output: Alice

# Modifying values
student["age"] = 21
print(student)          # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 21, 'major': 'Computer Science'}

# Adding a new key-value pair
student["gpa"] = 3.8
print(student)          # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 21, 'major': 'Computer Scien
```

## **Task 1: Data Types Unveiled**

Data types are like the building blocks of programming. They help us organize and work with different kinds of data. Let's break down the differences between three crucial data types: lists, tuples, and sets.

### **List: Your Versatile Collection**

* **Definition**: An ordered collection of items that can be of any type.
    
* **Key Characteristics**:
    
    * Items can be added, modified, and removed.
        
    * Enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`.
        

### **Tuple: Your Immutable Friend**

* **Definition**: An ordered collection of items that is unchangeable once created.
    
* **Key Characteristics**:
    
    * Similar to lists but uses parentheses `( )`.
        
    * Provides data integrity, perfect for constants.
        

### **Set: Your No-Duplicate Zone**

* **Definition**: An unordered collection of unique items.
    
* **Key Characteristics**:
    
    * Cannot contain duplicate values.
        
    * Created using curly braces `{ }`.
        

**Your Hands-On**: Create examples for each data type and take screenshots to showcase your understanding.

## **Task 2: Favorite Tools Dictionary**

Let's harness the power of dictionaries to organize and retrieve data efficiently. Here's a pre-made dictionary with your favorite DevOps tools. Your task is to use dictionary methods to retrieve tools using their numeric keys.

**Your Hands-On**: Write code that prints out your favorite DevOps tool by using its numeric key. For instance, `print(fav_tools[2])` should display "Git."

```plaintext
codefav_tools = {
    1: "Linux",
    2: "Git",
    3: "Docker",
    4: "Kubernetes",
    5: "Terraform",
    6: "Ansible",
    7: "Chef"
}

# Replace the 'key' with your favorite tool's corresponding key
favorite_tool_key = 2

# Using dictionary methods to print your favorite tool
if favorite_tool_key in fav_tools:
    favorite_tool = fav_tools[favorite_tool_key]
    print("My favorite tool is:", favorite_tool)
else:
    print("Favorite tool not found in the dictionary.")
```

In this example, I've used the key `2` to represent "Git" as your favorite tool. You can replace the `favorite_tool_key` value with the key corresponding to your actual favorite tool to print it using the dictionary.

## **Task 3: Cloud Providers Adventure**

Let's play with lists and add Digital Ocean to our list of cloud service providers. Then, let's sort the list alphabetically.

```plaintext
cloud_providers = ["AWS", "GCP", "Azure"]
new_provider = "Digital Ocean"

# Adding Digital Ocean to the list
cloud_providers.append(new_provider)

# Sorting the list in alphabetical order
cloud_providers.sort()

print("Updated cloud providers list:", cloud_providers)
```

When you run this program, it will add "Digital Ocean" to the list and then sort the list so that the output will be:

```plaintext
cloud providers list: ['AWS', 'Azure', 'Digital Ocean', 'GCP']
```

**Your Code Journey**:

1. Use the `append()` method to add "Digital Ocean" to `cloud_providers`.
    
2. Use the `sort()` method to alphabetically arrange the providers.
    

**Your Tools**:

* `append()` adds an item to the end of the list.
    
* `sort()` arranges items in alphabetical or numerical order.
